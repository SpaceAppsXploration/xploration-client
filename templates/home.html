<p>Hi, if you are here you are probably a space fans or have an idea of enjoying at reading about space.</p>
<p>This is a Web Application created to let you surf anything published on the Web about Space Exploration and related commercial activities. We have a list of approximately 80 different sources that provides information about space: feeds, posts, FB posts, Tweets. All of them are indexed and you can filter them in different ways.</p>
<p>This App is opensource software and can be useful for students and teachers to understand how space activities and related science take place in reality, and how they are lived and seen by professionals in the field. To help your exploration of the arguments, the App assigns to some items one or more keyword/s, and let you filter the same items by kind. A keen scientist can find interesting the "paper" category for example, or somebody more curious about news can find Tweets or blogs more interesting instead. There are some category to search and a lot of images and stories to read about.</p>
