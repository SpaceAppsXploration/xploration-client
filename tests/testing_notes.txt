Notes on testing setup for xpreader-client


Uses:
Mocha (test framework)
Chai (assertions)
Sinon (testing tools)
Sinon-Chai (syntactic sugar)
Testem (test-runner/auto-loader)


Summary:
Uses Testem runner to auto-run all *test.js files in directory "tests". Testem
will automatically rerun on test file changes. The Mocha+Chai combo is set for
BDD testing with "should"-style assertions.
But we can configure for any testing style.


Instructions:
Make sure you install the testing modules afte updating package.json
> npm install

You will also need the "testem.json" config file and a directory in root called
"tests".

Startup Testem from the command line:
> testem

and goto the specified browser address.

Then, write tests for your app modules!
The process is quite straightforward. You use require.js to bring in
modules you want to test. There are a couple sample test files to demonstrate
the basic flow. For an idea of the assertions at your disposal, you can visit:

http://chaijs.com/api/bdd

Then save the test "module" in the "tests" directory with a ""*test.js" extension
and if Testem is running it will auto-detect and run the tests.
